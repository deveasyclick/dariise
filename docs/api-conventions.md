# API conventions

Dariise's HTTP surface is versioned, schema-first and uniformly shaped: a route lives under `/v1`, parses a
`packages/contracts` schema, calls one service method, and fails through one error envelope. Decisions:
`docs/architecture.md §7`; role matrix: `docs/authorization.md`.

## The contract package

`packages/contracts` is the single source of truth for the wire contract: each domain ships a `zod` schema and
its TypeScript type is inferred with `z.infer`, never restated in `apps/api` or `apps/web`.

Its `imports` map exposes twenty subpaths, each resolving to `./src/<name>.ts`: `#api-key`, `#audit-log`,
`#auth`, `#change-request`, `#environment`, `#errors`, `#evaluation`, `#fields`, `#flag`, `#forms`, `#me`,
`#oauth`, `#pagination`, `#project`, `#project-member`, `#query`, `#segment`, `#session`, `#slug`,
`#workspace`.

The `exports` map publishes only the root entry, `.` → `./src/index.ts`, which re-exports every subpath.
Consumers import `@dariise/contracts`; a `#name` specifier resolves only inside the package, where one contract
file imports another (`flag.ts` uses `#environment`, `#pagination`, `#slug`).

## Module layout and layering

Each domain is one directory under `apps/api/src/modules/`:

```text
<name>.routes.ts       router factory; owns every path below its mount
<name>.controller.ts   HTTP wiring and input parsing
<name>.service.ts      business rules, authorization, transactions
<name>.repository.ts   the only place Drizzle tables are queried
<name>.mapper.ts · <name>.types.ts · <name>.index.ts   row → DTO · exported types · public surface
```

The layering is one-directional: `controller → service → repository`; nothing skips a layer and nothing goes
backward.

- The controller does HTTP only: it validates the request, calls one service method and returns its result.
- The service holds the rules; every mutating method asserts the caller's right to act, and transactions live here.
- The repository is the only file that imports and queries Drizzle tables, takes `organizationId` explicitly, and returns rows for a mapper.

A module reaches another module through its `index.ts` only. `app.ts` is the sole composition point: it builds
the graph in dependency order (repositories → services → controllers → routers), mounts the routers and owns
the error boundary. Cross-module needs are injected there — the flags service gets a segment-key validator, the
environments service a flag configuration copier, the projects service a default-environment creator, and the change-requests
service the flags module's validate/apply pair.

Shared types and constants live in `src/shared/types/` and `src/shared/constants.ts`; session middleware and
gates in `src/middleware/authorization.ts`; the Drizzle client, schema and audit writer in `src/db/`. Auth adds
`auth.config.ts` and `auth.cli.ts`; evaluation adds `evaluation.engine.ts`, the pure function in
`docs/architecture.md §5`.

## Route inventory

A routes file exports a `create<Name>Routes(deps)` factory that receives its controller and middleware; it never constructs a class. Routers mounted at `/v1/projects` own the paths below that prefix; routers mounted at
`/` spell out their `/v1` paths. Every router applies the session middleware to all of its paths except the auth router, which applies it to `/v1/me` alone; `/healthz` and `/readyz` are registered on the app before any
module router. Below, `…` stands for `/v1/projects/:projectKey/flags/:flagKey`.

## The error contract

Every Dariise failure is rendered by `errorResponse`, the single handler passed to `app.onError`. A thrown
`ApiError` becomes `{ error: { code, message, details? } }`; `details` appears only when the factory was given one.

| Factory | Status | Code value | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `badRequest(message, details?)` | 400 | `invalid_request` | optional |
| `unauthorized(message?)` | 401 | `unauthorized` | — |
| `forbidden(message)` | 403 | `forbidden` | — |
| `notFound(message)` | 404 | `not_found` | — |
| `conflict(message, details?)` | 409 | `conflict` | optional |
| `approvalRequired(environmentKey)` | 409 | `approval_required` | `{ environmentKey }` |

`ERROR_CODE` is the vocabulary; `internal_error` is the seventh value, with no factory because it is the fallback.
`approvalRequired` exists for a client with a next step: a direct publish to a protected environment is refused, and `details` names the environment so the dashboard can offer the change-request flow (`docs/change-requests.md`).

Any other thrown error is logged and returned as a generic 500 with code `internal_error` and no message, stack or internals. An unmatched path is rendered by `app.notFound` in the same shape, with literal code `not_found`
and message `No route for <path>.`; it is built inline rather than through a factory. The client schema is `apiErrorSchema` in `packages/contracts/src/errors.ts`.

## Better Auth's exception

`/api/auth/*` is registered with `routes.all` and forwards the raw request to `auth.handler`, so Better Auth renders its own responses. It is mounted at `/`, away from `/v1`, so its handler can never shadow a versioned router.
Its error contract is its own and is never wrapped in the `ApiError` envelope. Sessions and credentials are in `docs/authentication.md`.

## Cursor pagination

List endpoints take `?limit&cursor` and answer `{ data, nextCursor }`. `paginationQuerySchema` makes `limit` a
coerced integer, minimum 1, maximum `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` (100), defaulting to `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE` (50), and `cursor`
an optional string; the response shape is `Page<T>`, `{ data: T[]; nextCursor: string | null }`.

`encodeCursor` and `decodeCursor` use base64url, keeping the cursor opaque so a caller cannot depend on the ordering column. `toPage(rows, limit, cursorOf)` expects a query that fetched `limit + 1` rows: the extra row signals
another page, so no count query is issued, and the last page reports `nextCursor: null`. `paginatedSchema(item)` builds the matching contract schema. The list endpoints that paginate are environments, segments, API keys,
both flag lists, flag versions, change requests and audit logs.

## Naming and addressing

- Paths are plural and resource-oriented: `/projects`, `/environments`, `/flags`, `/segments`, `/api-keys`, `/change-requests`, `/audit-logs`.
- A named resource is addressed by its `key` in the URL (`:projectKey`, `:environmentKey`, `:flagKey`, `:segmentKey`);
  a foreign key is addressed by an id (`:userId` for a member, `:keyId` for an API key row). The rule is `key` in the URL, `id` for a foreign key.
- Keys are unique per parent, never globally, so the path carries the parent: `project.key` is unique within a workspace
  (`docs/architecture.md §2`), and a flag key is unique within a project, which is why the canonical flag path is `/v1/projects/:projectKey/flags/:flagKey`.
- A sub-resource nests under its parent (`/v1/projects/:projectKey/flags/:flagKey/environments/:environmentKey/rules`), not by repeating the prefix in each handler.
- Query parameters are camelCase and mirror the contract field names: `projectKey`, `environmentKey`, `includeArchived`, `includeRevoked`, `cursor`, `limit`.

## Validation

Every external input is parsed in the controller with a `packages/contracts` schema via `safeParse`; `await c.req.json()` is treated as `unknown` until then. A failed parse throws `ApiError.badRequest(firstIssue.message)` — the
first issue's message, not a field map. Path parameters the router guarantees are read through a helper that throws `badRequest` when one is missing, and a malformed JSON body is caught and reported as `badRequest("Send a valid JSON body.")`.

No validation middleware is used: no `@hono/zod-validator`, no per-route schema registry, no generated validator. The controller is the parse boundary. The approve/reject decision body is the one variation — the controller reads
`c.req.text()` and treats an empty body as `{}`.

## Cross-tenant reads

Queries are scoped by the session's `organizationId`, never by the body, a query parameter or a path segment. A read outside the caller's tenant or project membership answers 404 (`ApiError.notFound`), not 403: a 403 would confirm
the resource exists and enable enumeration. 403 remains the answer where the caller can see the resource but not act on it. The reasoning is in `docs/architecture.md §3`; the matrix and gate are in `docs/authorization.md`.

## Versioning and the OpenAPI gap

All Dariise endpoints live under `/v1`; the only paths outside it are Better Auth's `/api/auth/*` and the operational `/healthz` and `/readyz`.

No OpenAPI document is served: there is no `/v1/openapi.json` route, and no specification is generated from the Zod contracts.
Generating one from those contracts is an open gap in `docs/architecture.md §9`; the other gaps on that list are not API conventions.

## Status

- Exists: `packages/contracts` as the single source of truth; the `controller → service → repository` layering with `app.ts` as the only composition root; the sixty-three routes above;
  the `ApiError` envelope and the seven-value `ERROR_CODE` vocabulary; controller-side `safeParse` validation; cursor pagination on the list endpoints named above.
- Partial: two list endpoints return a bare array with no cursor — `GET /v1/projects` and `GET /v1/projects/:projectKey/members`.
- Not built: an OpenAPI document. `/v1/openapi.json` is not served and no specification is generated from the contract schemas (`docs/architecture.md §9`).

## Where it lives

- `apps/api/src/app.ts` — composition root, global middleware, router mounts and the single error boundary.
- `apps/api/src/server.ts` — the Node listener and graceful shutdown; no route or contract logic.
- `apps/api/src/middleware/authorization.ts` — `createSessionMiddleware`, `requireSession`, `requireWorkspace`.
- `apps/api/src/shared/http/errors.ts` — `ApiError`, its factories and `errorResponse`.
- `apps/api/src/shared/constants.ts` — the `ERROR_CODE` vocabulary.
- `apps/api/src/shared/pagination.ts` — `encodeCursor`, `decodeCursor`, `toPage`.
- `apps/api/src/shared/types/pagination.ts` — the `Page<T>` interface.
- `apps/api/src/modules/*/*.routes.ts` — one router per module; the paths in the inventory above.
- `packages/contracts/package.json` — the `exports` and `imports` maps.
- `packages/contracts/src/index.ts` — the root re-export of every subpath.
- `packages/contracts/src/pagination.ts` — `paginationQuerySchema`, the page sizes, `paginatedSchema`.
- `packages/contracts/src/errors.ts` — `apiErrorSchema` and `ApiErrorBody`.
- `packages/contracts/src/query.ts` — `booleanQueryParamSchema`.
- `.agents/skills/api/` — the long-form module, routing, contract and validation rules.
